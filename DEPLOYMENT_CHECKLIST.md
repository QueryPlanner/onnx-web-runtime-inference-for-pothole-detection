   - [ ] Deployment succeeds

#### Option 3: Self-Hosted (AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean)
```bash
# On server
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Create systemd service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pothole-backend.service
```

systemctl restart pothole-backend
git checkout previous_commit
systemctl start pothole-backend
```
